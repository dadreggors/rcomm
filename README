This project is a means to remotely issue commands to many servers and get the results on the client without using ssh.
This is not nearly as secure as ssh but it is easy to setup and use in a private network.
The focus here is not to replace ssh for remote commands, it is to allow remote execution on a large number of servers
once. There are several new technologies that facilitate this functionality however this does not require a config 
managment system as in puppet or salt stack to accomplish the same task.
